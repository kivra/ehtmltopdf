%% @doc Provides HTML to PDF conversion.
%%
%% Brokenness: at the time of writing, webkit doesn't support page-break-before,
%%   page-break-after or page-break-inside for inline elements so use block
%%   elements instead. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5097
%%
%% I'm trying to write this as basically as possible, yet trying not to assume
%% wkhtmltopdf as the actual PDF generating tool, e.g. giving the ehtmltopdf opt
%% 'print_media' results in the parameter --print-media-type to the wkhtmltopdf
%% call. On the other hand it's not worth generalizing for the entire world of
%% PDF tools right now.
%%
%% Lesson learnt: CSS page-break-before is unrelated to the print media type
%% unless you specifically restrict that CSS to the print media type. Probably
%% obvious but not immediately to me :)
%%
%% The version of wkhtmltopdf used right now is "wkhtmltopdf 0.10.0 rc2"
