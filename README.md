# ehtmltopdf

Erlang wrapper for converting HTML to PDF.

Right now it wraps `wkhtmltopdf` and it might eventually wrap other external
programs or libraries.

The application environment config should indicate where wkhtmltopdf is
installed by setting the Application configuration parameter `wkhtmltopdf_path`
with a string in your `app.config`. The default is `"wkhtmltopdf"` which
implies that wkhtmltopdf is in your `PATH`.

Example ```app.config```:
``` erlang
[
 {ehtmltopdf,
  [{wkhtmltopdf_path, "/usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf"}]}
].
```

## Load testing

Download and compile basho_bench first, then

    ERL_LIBS=path_to_ehtmltopdf ./basho_bench path_to_ehtmltopdf/priv/ehtmltopdf_bb_driver.config

Note: It will copy priv/mess.svg to your /tmp to make the <img> path simple.

    make results

Enjoy the beautiful results in `tests/current/summary.png` etc.

As a reference, on some MacBook Pro I got a consistent 3 converts per second
for 5 minutes. RAM usage looked sane, CPU usage was high. Changing the config
to have 6 concurrent workers leads to about 4 operations per second. In both
cases the Ops/sec tends slowly upwards.
